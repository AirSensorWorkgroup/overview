<b>Air Sensors Workgroup: Overview</b>

Reporting of data and time is critical for interpreting environmental information. An air quality measurement represents the air quality during a particular period of time, known as the time interval. In order to describe the time interval, it is essential to know the start time and end time of the measurement. The date/time reporting formats and definitions of time interval for air quality sensor data will be modeled after ISO 8601 standards to streamline data sharing. Details on the ISO standard are available online (<a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/iso8601.htm">ISO</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601"> Wiki</a>) and are briefly described below. 

<b>Who We Are</b>

The Air Sensors Workgroup (ASW) is a collaboration among experts from a diversity of fields and types of organizations including non-governmental, industry, government, and academia.  We share a vision that low-cost air sensor networks if widely deployed have the potential to change our understanding of how people are being impacted by air pollution.  To achieve this vision we need to produce readily accessible and reliable data that can be analyzed and interpreted by anyone interested to produce actionable information.

<b>Goals</b>

ASW aims to create and share norms for those involved in building and/or using low-cost sensor networks that will facilitate the sharing of data such that it is maximally useful and expedite the evaluation of low-cost sensors.  ASWâ€™s goal is to ensure that the transaction costs associated with combining data sets and deploying sensor systems are minimal in order to allow many groups to participate in the sensor revolution constructively.
