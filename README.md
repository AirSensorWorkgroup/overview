<b>Who We Are</b>

The Air Sensors Workgroup (ASW) is a collaboration among experts from a diversity of fields and types of organizations including non-governmental, industry, government, and academia.  We share a vision that low-cost air sensor networks if widely deployed have the potential to change our understanding of how people are being impacted by air pollution.  To achieve this vision we need to produce readily accessible and reliable data that can be analyzed and interpreted by anyone interested to produce actionable information.

<b>Goals</b>

ASW aims to create and share norms for those involved in building and/or using low-cost sensor networks that will facilitate the sharing of data such that it is maximally useful and expedite the evaluation of low-cost sensors.  ASWâ€™s goal is to ensure that the transaction costs associated with combining data sets and deploying sensor systems are minimal in order to allow many groups to participate in the sensor revolution constructively.
